        title: "Professional Journey of Leah Taylor Roy",
        content: `My career has always been shaped by my desire to make a meaningful impact. After earning my degrees, I worked at the World Bank, where I analyzed global economic policies, gaining a broader understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing developing economies. I then joined McKinsey & Company, where I advised Canadian businesses on strategies to drive growth and address national challenges.
Later, I became the Executive Vice President of my familyâ€™s green energy co-generation company, where I led eco-friendly initiatives that supported sustainable energy solutions. These experiences have guided the way I approach my work in Parliament, combining business, public policy, and sustainability to create lasting, positive change for our community.
